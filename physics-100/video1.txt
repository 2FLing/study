reflection:
The light ray changes direction depending on the two media's refractive index in which it is transmitted through.
If they are different media, the probability of having the same refractive index is very minimal. 
light's direction must change as it enters a different media from the one it was initially transmitted through.
how is that going to be happened?
imagin there is a light ray is going through the medium from lower refractive index medium.

these are the light particles, they travel on the same speed before they enter the
higher refractive index.
Once the first particle`ve entered the higher refractive index,
it gets slower, while the rest of the particles are still at the 
same speed as they were. Because light travels slower when it is in higher
refractive medium.
It bends the light, because these
particles are divide into two parts, the part in lower refractive
index travel fast while the part in higher refractive index travel
slow. That is how light direction changes when going through two 
different media.


Huygens's principle:

Huygens's principle was a useful technique that helped determine where and how waves and light rays propagate in detail. 
imagin there is a light hits this point right here.
There are many hyguns sources on the reflecting surface, they will
be actived after the incident light hits them.
once them get activated and they start giving out secondary waves.
The time for which the secondary wave the reflected wave was traveling,
at the same time it took this wavefront right here to go from here.
and the reflected wave has the same speed as the incident wave.
so the radius of the reflected wave should equals to the distance
travelled by the incident wave.
the reflective ray must be tengent to the reflected wave front.
That is how Huygen`s principle determind where and how waves and light rays propagate.
