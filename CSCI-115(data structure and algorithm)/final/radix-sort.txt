radix-sort(A,d):
	let C to be a new array
	C = A
	for i = 0 to d:
		let B to be a new array[0...9]
		for j = 0 to 9
			B[j] = 0
		for i = 1 to A.len
			k  = A[i]/pow(10,i)
			k  = k % 10
			B[k] = B[k] + 1
		for i = 1 to B.len
			B[i] = B[i] + B[i-1]
		for i = C.len to 1
			k = C[i]/pow(10,i)
			k = k % 10
			A[B[k]] = C[i]
			B[k] = B[k] - 1
		C = A

Time complexity: O(d*(n+k)) where d is the range of digits, and n  is the size of the array, k is the radix used,
here it is 10.
