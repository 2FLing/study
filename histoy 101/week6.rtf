launched a critical phase of the African American struggle for civil rights. Its statistical refutation of the rape charge against black men that was used to justify lynching is a sociological breakthrough that has stood the test of time and study. Wells 
also demonstrates how the concepts of \'93race\'94 and \'93rape\'94
 were tied to power relations in the administration of justice, in the media, and in everyday life. Finally, Wells expounds the racial and class dimensions of the sexual double standard in ways that con
nect to contemporary feminist concerns with violence against all women, communities of color, and the poor in the United States and globally.

\par The prospect of better wages and the presence of extended family soon drew Wells to Memphis, Tennessee. There, her intellectual, social, and political horizons expanded in a burgeoning black community notable for its highly accomplished middle-class and e
l
ite members. Aspirations for equality nourished community institutions like schools, newspapers, social clubs, literary lyceums, and churches, especially the Baptist and African Methodist Episcopal denominations. In Memphis, Wells found encouragement to t
u
rn her intellectual talents into leadership by teaching Sunday school and by pursuing literary activities, especially journalism. Her first newspaper article appeared in 1883 in a Baptist weekly. It explained how Wells had been unfairly ejected from a fir
st-class \'93ladies\'94 railroad coach and how she fought racial discrimination by taking her case to court. While tens of thousands of educated women joined the paid labor force as school \'93ma\rquote ams,\'94
 religious educators, and journalists in the late nineteenth century, these social roles had particular significance for African American women, whose\~
personal, family, and community well-being was intimately bound up with their wage earning, educational activities, and community-betterment work.

 segregation, a set of laws designed for the economic deprivation, social marginalization, and political disfranchisement of black people. Jim Crow was established and enforced through systematic violence and terror. Ida B. Wells\rquote

s sharp scrutiny in the press and eventually, while in Memphis, she caught the negative attention of critics. As the following excerpt explains, she was forced to leave the Sou
th as a kind of political exile, first traveling to New York, then to Great Britain, and finally settling in Chicago in 1895. There, she married lawyer and fellow activist Ferdinand L. Barnett (hyphenating her name to Wells-Barnett) and raised a family of
 four children.
\par Post-exile, Wells-Barnett\rquote s writing and activism were sustained through African American community networks and by organizations shared by black and white women reformers, such as the Woman\rquote s Christian Temperance Union. Her work with black w
omen\rquote s church and club networks nurtured her into a powerful public speaker and political organizer. Between 1892 and 1895, Wells-Barnett organized scores of antilynching committees and women\rquote 
s clubs all over the United States and abroad and helped inaugur
ate the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), a group that functioned as the preeminent civil rights organization up to World War I. In 1909, Wells-Barnett cofounded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which, in
 1917, assumed principal leadership of the antilynching fight in the United States.
\par The trajectory of Wells-Barnett\rquote s civil rights agitation was neither simple nor smooth. Controversy followed her and her work, especially during its first decade. White supr
emacists in the North and South vilified her in the press, slandering her morals and threatening her with violence for speaking out against lynching. While most African American communities embraced Wells-Barnett as a heroine, there was little consensus a
b
out how, exactly, to end lynching or resist Jim Crow. Black leaders were a diverse group ideologically and generationally; regional considerations also came into play as black Southerners found themselves more circumscribed than their northern peers. Wome
n\rquote s roles were also fundamental to the building of black communities and to resistance work. Though black women\rquote 
s families and communities were dependent upon their contributions, any move on their part into official political and intellectual leadership\emdash especially where interactions with whites were concerned\emdash 
usually sparked controversy. Whether in journalism, public speaking, or institutional leadership\emdash as with her Chicago social settlement, the Negro Fellowship League (1909\endash 1919)\emdash Wells-Barnett\rquote s initiatives\~
were always double-edged, affording new spaces for community defense and activism while potentially exposing black men as somehow deficient in their protective or leadership roles. For every celebration of her hard work and successes, there were always 
powerful voices affirming the propriety of male ministers, business leaders, and elected officials leading the civil rights agenda for African Americans. Wells-Barnett remained staunchly committed to equality for black women, however, fighting hard for su
ffrage rights in Illinois and nationally. After the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, she eventually ran for public office herself, in 1930.

 including education, boycotts, migration, agitation for protective legislation, suing through the courts, and even armed self-defense, to be \'93used to give that protection which the law refuses to give.\'94
 Nearly five thousand Americans, almost three fourths of them black, were lynched in Wells-Barnett\rquote

\par The editorial in question was prompted by the many inhuman and fiendish lynchings of Afro-Americans which have recen
tly taken place and was meant as a warning. Eight lynched in one week and five of them charged with rape! The thinking public will not easily believe freedom and education more brutalizing than slavery, and the world knows that the crime of rape was unkno

\par Since my business has been destroyed and I am an exile from home because of that editorial, the issue h
as been forced, and as the writer of it I feel that the race and the public generally should have a statement of the facts as they exist. They will serve at the same time as a defense for the Afro-American Sampsons who suffer themselves to be betrayed by

 of white women and his paper suppressed; but the truth remains that Afro-American men do not always rape (?) white women without their consent.

 man came to the kitchen door, forced his way in the house and insulted her. She tried to drive him out with a heavy poker, but he overpowered and chloroformed her, and when she revived her clothing was torn and she was in a horrible condition. She did no

The prisoner vehemently denied the charge of rape, but confessed he went to Mrs. Underwood\rquote s residence at her invitation and was criminally intimate with her at her request. This availed him nothing against the sworn testimony of a minister\rquote 
s wife, a lady of the highest respectability. He was found guilty, and entered the penitentiary, December 14, 1888, for fifteen years. Some time afterwards the woman\rquote s remorse led her to confess to her husband that the man was innocent.
\par These are her words: \'93I met Offett at the Post Office. It was raining. He was polite to me, and as I had several bundles in my arms he offered to c
arry them home for me, which he did. He had a strange fascination for me, and I invited him to call on me. He called, bringing chestnuts and candy for the children. By this means we got them to leave us alone in the room. Then I sat on his lap. He made a 
p
roposal to me and I readily consented. Why I did so, I do not know, but that I did is true. He visited me several times after that and each time I was indiscreet. I did not care after the first time. In fact I could not have resisted, and had no desire to
 resist.\'94
\par When asked by her husband why she told him she had been outraged, she said: \'93I had several reasons for telling you. One was the neighbors saw the fellow here, another was, I was afraid I had contracted a loathsome disease, and still another was th

scaped me, left home, husband and children, and ran away with her black coachman. She was with him a month before her husband found and brought her home. The coachman could not be found. The doctor moved his family away from Memphis, and is living in anot
her city under an assumed name.\'85
\par Sarah Clark of Memphis loved a black man and lived openly with him. When she was indicted last spring for miscegenation, she swore in court that she was\~}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 not}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 \~a white woman. This she did to escape the penitentiary and continued her illicit relation undisturbed. That she is of the lower class of whites, does not disturb the fact that she is a white woman. \'93
The leading citizens\'94 of Memphis are defending the \'93honor\'94 of\~}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 all}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 \~white women,\~}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0

has been run away from Memphis by the guardians of the honor of Southern white women, a young girl living on Poplar St., who was discovered in intimate relations with a handsome mulatto young colored man, Will Morgan by name, stole her father\rquote 
s money to send the young fellow away from that father\rquote s wrath. She has since joined him in Chicago.\'85
\par The very week the \'93leading citizens\'94 of Memphis were making a spectacle of themselves in defense of all white women of every kind, an Afro-American, M. Stricklin, was found in a white woman\rquote 
s room in that city. Although she made no outcry of rape, he was jailed and would have been lynched, but the woman stated she bought curtains of him (he was a furniture dealer) and his business in her room that night was to put them up. A white woman
\rquote s word was taken as absolutely in this case as when the cry of rape is made, and he was freed.
\par What is true of Memphis is true of the entire South.\'85 Frank Weems of Chattanooga who was not lynched in May only because the prominent citizens became his body guard until the doors of the penitentiary closed on\~
him, had letters in his pocket from the white woman in the case, making the appointment with him. Edward Coy who was burned alive in Texarkana, January 1, 1892, died protesting his innocence. Investigation since as given by the Bystander in the\~}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 Chicago Inter-Ocean}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 , October 1, proves:\'85
 The woman who was paraded as a victim of violence was of bad character; her husband was a drunkard and a gambler.\'85 She was compelled by threats, if not by violence, to make the charge against the victim.\'85
 When she came to apply the match Coy asked her if she would burn him after they had \'93been sweethearting\'94 so long.\'85
\par Hundreds of such cases might be cited, but enough have been given to prove the assertion that there are white women in the South who love the Afro-American\rquote 
s company even as there are white men notorious for their preference for Afro-American women.
\par There is hardly a town in the South which has not an instance of the kind which is well-known, and hence the assertion is reiterated that \'93nobody in the South believes the old thread-bare lie that negro men rape white women.\'94
 Hence there is a growing demand among Afro-Americ
ans that the guilt or innocence of parties accused of rape be fully established. They know the men of the section of the country who refuse this are not so desirous of punishing rapists as they pretend. The utterances of the leading white men show that wi
th them it is not the crime but the\~}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 class}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 , Bishop Fitzgerald has become apologist for lynchers of the rapists of\~}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 white}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 \~women only.\'85 But when the victim is a colored woman it is different.
\par Last winter in Baltimore, Md., three white ruffians assaulted a Miss 
Camphor, a young Afro-American girl, while out walking with a young man of her own race. They held her escort and outraged the girl. It was a deed dastardly enough to arouse Southern blood, which gives its horror of rape as excuse for lawlessness, but she
 was an Afro-American. The case went to the courts, an Afro-American lawyer defended the men and they were acquitted.
\par In Nashville, Tenn., there is a white man, Pat Hanifan, who outraged a little Afro-American girl, and, from the physical injuries received, she has been ruined for life. He was jailed for six months, discharged, and is now a detective in that city.\'85
 Only two weeks before Eph. Grizzard, who had only been\~}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 charged}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 \~
with rape upon a white woman, had been taken from the jail, with Governor Buchanan
 and the police and militia standing by, dragged through the streets in broad daylight, knives plunged into him at every step, and with every fiendish cruelty a frenzied mob could devise, he was at last swung out on the bridge with hands cut to pieces as 
he tried to climb up the stanchions.\'85
\par At the very moment these civilized whites were announcing their determination \'93to protect their wives and daughters,\'94 by murdering Grizzard, a white man was in the same jail for raping eight-year-old Maggie Reese, an Af
ro-American girl. He was not harmed. The \'93honor\'94
 of grown women who were glad enough to be supported by the Grizzard boys and Ed Coy, as long as the liaison was not known, needed protection; they were white. The outrage upon helpless childhood needed no avenging in this case; she was black.\'85

 Thoughtful Afro-Americans with the strong arm of the government withdrawn and with the hope to stop such wholesale massacres urged the race to sacrifice its political rights for the sake of peace. They honestly believed the race should fit itself for gov
ernment, and when that should be done, the objection to race participation in politics would be removed.

But the sacrifice did not remove the trouble, nor move the South to justice. One by one the Southern States have legally (?) disfranchised the Afro-Ame
rican, and since the repeal of the Civil Rights Bill nearly every Southern State has passed separate car laws with a penalty against their infringement. The race regardless of advancement is penned into filthy, stifling partitions cut off from smoking car
s.\'85 The dark and bloody record of the South shows 728 Afro-Americans lynched during the past eight years;\'85 and not less than 150 have been known to have met violent death at the hands of cruel bloodthirsty mobs during the past nine months.
\par To palliate this 
record (which grows worse as the Afro-American becomes intelligent) and excuse some of the most heinous crimes that ever stained the history of a country, the South is shielding itself behind the plausible screen of defending the honor of its women. This,
 too, in the face of the fact that only\~}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 one-third}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 \~of the 728 victims to mobs have been\~}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0

\par Even to the better class of Afro-Americans the crime of rape is so revolting they have too\~often taken the white man\rquote s word and given lynch law neither the investigation nor condemnation it deserved.
\par They forget that a concession of the right to lynch a man for a certain crime, not only concedes the right to lynch any person for 
any crime, but (so frequently is the cry of rape now raised) it is in a fair way to stamp us a race of rapists and desperadoes. They have gone on hoping and believing that general education and financial strength would solve the difficulty, and are devoti
ng their energies to the accumulation of both.\'85

\f0\fs24\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710 ary McLeod Bethune was one of the most distinguished educators of her generation. The daughter of slaves, she rec
eived her early education from missionary teachers. Like others of her race who saw education as a key to racial advancement at a time when the white South was indifferent if not hostile to the aspirations of African Americans, Bethune faced extraordinary
 obstacles. When she began a little school at Daytona Beach, Florida, in 1904, America was entering an era of reform. Yet even most northern progressives\emdash 
with the notable exception of women such as Mary White Ovington, one of the founders of the NAACP\emdash share
d the racist assumptions of that era, believing that the future of black women, like immigrant women, lay in domestic service. Bethune had larger dreams. Because of her courage, energy, and vision, she was able to keep her school afloat with her intrepid 
fundraising, guiding its growth from grammar school to high school and to what finally became an accredited four-year college. President of the institution from its founding until her resignation in 1942, she remained a trustee of Bethune\endash 
Cookman College until her death in 1955. She was an activist and held many important posts within the black community, founding such organizations as the National Association of Colored Women\rquote 
s Clubs and the National Council of Negro Women. A national figure as well, she se
rved in the Roosevelt administration during the 1930s, advising the president on minority affairs. She was also involved in early efforts on behalf of the United Nations. Her many offices and honors, however, never diverted her from her primary purpose
\emdash the pursuit of full citizenship rights for all black Americans.}{\field\fldedit{\*\fldinst {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid8866710\charrsid8866710

We burned logs and used the charred splinters as pencils, and mashed elderberries\~for ink. I begged strangers for a broom, a lamp, a 
bit of cretonne to put around the packing case which served as my desk. I haunted the city dump and the trash piles behind hotels, retrieving discarded linen and kitchenware, cracked dishes, broken chairs, pieces of old lumber. Everything was scoured and 
m
ended. This was part of the training to salvage, to reconstruct, to make bricks without straw. As parents began gradually to leave their children overnight, I had to provide sleeping accommodations. I took corn sacks for mattresses. Then I picked Spanish 
moss from trees, dried and cured it, and used it as a substitute for mattress hair.
